This page is a record of the progress reports made by the team working on Bulletin. Progress reports will be made weekly by midnight on Sunday.

## 12/02/2012

**What we said we were going to do this week.** Editing groups, inbox, code cleanup/revision. UI for email invites/invites. If there is enough time, also have posts update using AJAX. Also, consider adding options based on need and time.

**What we did this week.** Posts update live (AJAX). Had a UI/UX review where we gained useful information as well as arguments to not include inbox. Updated testing. Revision of the UI.

**What we are going to do next week.** Inbox. UI revision. Code cleanup/revision. Testing.

**Issues.** None.

## 11/25/2012

**What we said we were going to do this week.** Editing groups, inbox, code cleanup/revision. UI for email invites/invites. If there is enough time, also have posts update using AJAX.

**What we did this week.** Nothing. We decided to begin work again after Thanksgiving.

**What we are going to do next week.** Editing groups, inbox, code cleanup/revision. UI for email invites/invites. If there is enough time, also have posts update using AJAX. Also, consider adding options based on need and time.

**Issues.** None.

## 11/18/2012

**What we said we were going to do this week.** UI, email invites, editing groups, group invites, testing, comments to posts.

**What we did this week.** UI changes, email invites, group invites, testing, comments to posts, password recovery. We decided to move part of group editing (removing members from a group, editing group name) to the next revision, the changes for this cycle were significant enough to require more time to properly implement. Emails are now implemented using the django mass_mail function. Email invites haven't yet been implemented on the front-end.

**What we are going to do next week.** Editing groups, inbox, code cleanup/revision. UI for email invites/invites. If there is enough time, also have posts update using AJAX.

**Issues.** The transition to AJAX and JSON has made code less explicit than before, and therefore made making changes take more time than previously estimated. There's also still some trouble with supporting IE.

## 11/11/2012

**What we said we were going to do this week.** Add features: creating groups, email invites. Write functional tests/update testing, polish styling and, if styling is complete, begin ajax.

**What we did this week.** Added feature of group creation. Reworked back-end structure to accommodate group creation. Presented features of the first release/demo. Worked on password restrictions. Polished and restyled/redesigned the UI.

**What we are going to do next week.** UI, email invites, editing groups, group invites, testing, comments to posts.

**Issues.** We hadn't tested cross-browser compatibility, such that during the presentation we had some bugs with some of the buttons functioning properly on the live-site.

## 11/04/2012

**What we said we were going to do this week.** We were to determine what issues need to be fixed last week, as well as assigning pairs and tasks to individuals. We were to attempt to bring the prototype/release forward into a "testable" state. We were to attempt to combine login/registration with posting to groups, instead of the previous prototype of leaving the two independent of each-other. We were to also start writing up parts of the UI with ajax (posts/comments/updates).

**What we did this week.** We've re-written the app, found issues to work on, and assigned tasks to individuals. We've started using the github Issues page to determine the issues which need to be addressed. Tests have been written for parts of the app. We've combined login/registration with site users. We've decided to delay ajax for the next release.

**What we are going to do next week.** Add features: creating groups, email invites. Write functional tests/update testing, polish styling and, if styling is complete, begin ajax.

**Issues.** None.

## 10/28/2012

**What we said we were going to do this week.** The goals for last week were to improve upon the prototype, plan our presentation, and add documentation to the prototype.

**What we did this week.** This week we revised the requirements and architecture papers, as well as plan and execute the presentation for our web-app. We added some features to the prototype, and added a UI. We fleshed out the UI/UX. We've also looked at unit testing for python.

**What we are going to do next week.** We will be determining what issues need to be fixed this week, as well as assigning pairs and tasks to individuals. We will attempt to bring the prototype/release forward into a "testable" state. We'll attempt to combine login/registration with posting to groups, instead of the current prototype of leaving the two independent of each-other. We'll also start writing up parts of the UI with ajax (posts/comments/updates).

**Issues.** We were unable to meet on Thursday of this week due to the CSE Career Fair. This week was a busy week, leaving less time to focus on Bulletin.

## 10/21/2012

**What we said we were going to do this week.** The goals for last week were to get a prototype up, and to release the schedule, with included milestones.

**What we did this week.** This week we were able to release a prototype (www.bulletinapp.net/prototype). The schedule should be completed fairly shortly. The back-end and front-end developers have begun working towards the first release product. We received feedback on the requirements and architecture papers, and are working to revise them and clarify our intent. Mock-ups for the website have been improved upon/updated.

**What we are going to do next week.** The goals for the upcoming week are to improve upon the prototype, plan our presentation, and add documentation to the prototype.

**Issues.** There have been some problems with testing and using/setting up python and Django, but most of these should be resolved within the next two weeks.

## 10/14/2012

**What we said we were going to do this week.** Last week we hoped to cement how we'd implement the project, as well as acclimate to the tools that we'd locked in for use.

**What we did this week.** This week we worked out much of the architecture, design, and tools that we'd use for the project, as well as the process plan. We've split the team into 2 partitions, front-end and back-end, and have fairly cement idea of how the project will be implemented. We've all been learning python and django, as well as looking into bootstrap and its use with django.

**What we are going to do next week.** The goals for the upcoming week are to get a prototype finished, and to release the schedule, with included milestones.

**Issues.** We've come to realize the difficulty in assigning tasks to different individuals, as well as assuming responsibility for said tasks. There's also the difficulty in deciding on the overall design when many of the members haven't had experience with django or bootstrap.

## 10/07/2012

This week we were able to determine our requirements, team meeting times (Tuesdays and Thursdays), and the PM.

This upcoming week we hope to cement how we'll implement the project, as well as acclimate to the tools that we've locked in for use. We had a little trouble settling on a communication medium to use, but we were able to settle on google docs and facebook groups.
