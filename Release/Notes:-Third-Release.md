## Bulletin

### Overview
The third release of Bulletin introduces the Inbox as well as many other changes, including in the UI/UX.

### Functionality
* **Inbox** Users can view recent posts and comments in the Inbox. Clicking on a link for each item in the Inbox will bring users to the group which the post/comment was made in.
* **Live updates of posts and comments** Users don't have to refresh the page in order to see changes in groups that they are viewing. New posts and comments will automatically appear.
* **Show more comments** When there are more than 7 comments on a post, only the most recent comments will be shown. Older comments can be seen by clicking a button.
* **Show more posts** When there are more than 5 posts to a group, only the most recent posts will be shown. Older posts can be seen by clicking a button.
* **Show group members** Users can now see who's a member of groups they are in. This appears in the left sidebar.
* **Show pending invites** Users can see people who have been invited to the group, but have not yet joined.
* **Landing page intro** The landing page has been redone to prioritize new visitors.
* **Revamped error pages** Error pages have been updated.
* **Changed visual layout of comments** Comments now take up less space than previously, allowing for more content to fill the page.
* **Removing users from a group** Users who own a group can remove users from the group. Doing so will currently remove all related posts/comments by the removed user.

### Exceptions
Some things that might not be working:
* If a visitor correctly guesses a user's email, the visitor can cause the user's password to reset.
* Registration emails can be delayed for prolonged periods of time (email isn't always immediately sent).
