**What we said you were going to do this week.** Redesign of the UI to get something that looks more polished and meet up with Caylan and Ivan to do some group programming.

**What we did this week.** Did everything that I said I would do. The redesign looks successful, still needs a bit of work and support for future features.

**What we are going to do next week.** More work on the UI, hopefully will get AJAX to work for refreshing the post/comment information.

**Issues.** None.

**What we said you were going to do this week.** Start working on the UI redesign.

**What we did this week.** Started working on the UI redesign, coming into place but needs to be refactored into a better hierarchy of templates.

**What we are going to do next week.** Polish the redesign up a bit and add new features as they come from the backend.

**Issues.** None.

**What we said you were going to do this week.** Modify the prototype UI so it is more presentable for the new release and get a local server up for testing.

**What we did this week.** Got a usable UI up and a local server.

**What we are going to do next week.** Scrap the old UI and build a new one basically from scratch.

**Issues.** None.

**What we said you were going to do this week.** I will continue to work on the UI, adding more features and trying to get a testing environment up so that I can test the python code I write.

**What we did this week.**  I finished the UI for the prototype and I helped with the write-up for the prototype. Wasn't able to get my virtual server up, will try to do that after midterms.

**What we are going to do next week.** Depending on where the backend features go, continuing to work on the UI and/or start with ajax stuff. Also will be trying to get a testing environment up so that I can test the python code I write.

**Issues.** None.

**What we said you were going to do this week.** Last week I was going to start working on the front-end UI to try to get something presentable for the prototype/demo.

**What we did this week.**  Although I didn't get as much done as I would have liked, what I have is a step in the right direction for what we want our project to look like.

**What we are going to do next week.** I will continue to work on the UI, adding more features and trying to get a testing environment up so that I can test the python code I write.

**Issues.** I was without a virtual server to test my python code, so that was a bit frustrating, hopefully will get that up this week.
